The strategy for ant behavior:
1, global dispatcher dispatches tasks at the beginning of the gameloop, then individual ant carry out task.
2, local information.
1.	For each food location, the ants that is associated with it.
2.	For each ant, the task it is doing.
3.	For each ant, the path if will go. 
4.	For each ant, the food location it is associated. (redundant with 1, remember to update both)
5.	For each ant, it��s being attacked.
3, the global dispatcher:
1.	Check if any ant is under attack, correspond.  Or check if you want to attack some ant. Ant fleeing home may be considered not associated with any food site.
2.	Check if any food location requires more labor, and if you have ant in nest, or free exploring ant, dispatch it there.
3.	Collision detection.
4, the individual ant.
1.	check if last move is carried out. If not, repeat, or do something.
2.	send out next move based on it��s task.

Known issues
- Ants might crash onto water and get stuck
- Sometimes the server rejects our actions because they are lagging.
- Sometimes ants don't get out of nest and don't get assigned a path. They just get stuck.
- Sometimes for some reason, ants go back to nest without carrying anything and get stuck.
- There might be a problem with making new ants.

Missing features
- Distinction between different ant types is non existent
- No go to enemy, or go to friendly ant

To run please type in the server name as a command line argument. The port number must be changed from constants.
This is something that was already like this.
